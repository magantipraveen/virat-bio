        Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
        cricketer who currently plays Test cricket and ODI cricket for India. Kohli is a former T20I player and a former
        captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm
        quick bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. He
        holds the record as the highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the
        fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI
        cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli is widely regarded as one of
        the greatest batsmen of all time and the greatest batsman in the modern era.[citation needed] Kohli was a key
        member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and
        captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[5]

        In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of
        T20I rankings.[6] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the
        number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In
        2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[7]

        Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards which is more than any player in International Cricket, making him the most
        decorated player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in
        2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year,
        on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and
        Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World
        for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the second most and most 'Player of the Match' and
        'Player of the Series' awards to his name, respectively, in all three formats combined. At the national level,
        Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour,
        the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential
        people in the world.

        After winning the 2024 T20 World Cup, Kohli announced his retirement from T20I.[8]

        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli,
        worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas,
        and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early
        education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for
        cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.[11]

        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd
        espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him
        to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his
        son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just
        playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in
        the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate
        his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli
        eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[14] He received training at the academy while
        simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[15] In
        pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade
        education.[13

        Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a match against the host
        state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs. His first
        half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Haryana.[2] By the
        end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with
        an average of 34.40.[3] During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the Under-15 team. In
        his first match of the season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture
        against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the
        end of the season, he had amassed a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[4][5]
        Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi Under-17
        team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being
        251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his
        temperament on the field.[6][7] Kohli commenced the 2005–06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following
        their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the
        semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to
        his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with
        a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[8] He ended as the
        highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[9]
    </p>
    <p>In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the
        three-match ODI series against England Under-19s,[18] while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test
        series.[19] Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput
        noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for profound technical
        prowess.[20] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and
        28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the second match, he contributed 83 runs to India's
        victory by 240 runs and an innings. He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore.[21] In
        early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India Under-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the
        first Test match. The series ended in a draw, with a 1–1 score line. In the following month, the team travelled
        to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many
        opportunities to bat. In July–August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka
        Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. However, he
        made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.[22]

        In February–March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 2008
        Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a batsman, amassing 235 runs in 6
        games at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to
        compile a century.[23] His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a
        group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This innings paved the
        way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award.[24] Additionally, Kohli's all-round
        performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs
        in the run-chase, was significant to India's 3-wicket victory.[25] In the championship match, Kohli managed a
        modest score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s, his contribution lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L
        method).[26]

        In June of the year 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded
        the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided
        an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[27] In a bid to
        identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the
        Emerging Players Tournament of 2008. Notably, his finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand
        Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an
        aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the national selectors who were observing
        his progress. He began his international cricket journey by joining the senior team in Colombo, having played 28
        Under-19 ODIs and 12 Under-19 Tests.[28]</p>

        In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in
        Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his
        belt.[29] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[30] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both
        first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required
        to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[31] On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international
        debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by
        an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[32] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his inaugural
        half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[33]

        Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured
        Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[34] Despite
        limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49
        runs.[35] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian
        Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett
        Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting
        prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating
        his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[36]

        In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England.
        However, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[37] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded
        a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for
        the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$50,000 in
        2023).[38] Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against
        Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[39]

        Kohli holds a prominent place in the annals of Indian cricket. He has the distinction of being the only cricketer to have been named the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup on two separate occasions, in 2014 and 2016.[130] In terms of ODI centuries, he ranks first with 50.[131] He surpassed Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 49 ODI tons and achieved this feat on 15 November 2023 in the semifinal of the 2023 Cricket World Cup, while also becoming the first player to score more than 700 runs in a single edition of the tournament.[132] Furthermore, in international cricket, Kohli has amassed 80 centuries, second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 100 centuries.[133] In 2018, Kohli set a record, becoming the first player to score 1,000 ODI runs in 11 innings in a calendar year.[134] In 2022, he achieved another milestone by scoring 1,000 runs in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, becoming the second player to reach this feat after Mahela Jayawardene.[135] During the match against Bangladesh, he became the top-scorer in the history of T20 World Cup.[136]
